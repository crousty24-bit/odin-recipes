            <p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes.</p>
            <p>Serve with basmati rice and naan bread</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
                <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
                <li>1 (14-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
                <li>Fresh cilantro for garnish</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>   
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and chili powder. Add the chicken pieces and coat them well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet or pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato sauce to the pan and stir well. Cook for about 10 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and the flavors to meld together.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the sauce is simmering, preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and grill for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked and slightly charred.</li>
                <li>Add the grilled chicken pieces to the sauce and stir to coat them well. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes to allow the chicken to absorb the flavors of the sauce.</li>
                <li>Season with salt to taste. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with basmati rice and naan bread. Enjoy your delicious chicken makhani!</li>
