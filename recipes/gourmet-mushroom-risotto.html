        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice</li>
                <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
                <li>1 cup white wine</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped mushrooms (cremini, shiitake, or button)</li>
                <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>   
                <li>In a saucepan, heat the vegetable broth and keep it warm over low heat.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they release their moisture and become tender.</li>
                <li>Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and stir to coat the rice with the oil and butter. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the rice is lightly toasted.</li>
                <li>Pour in the white wine and cook, stirring constantly, until the wine is mostly absorbed by the rice.</li>
                <li>Begin adding the warm vegetable broth one ladle at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until most of the liquid is absorbed before adding the next ladle of broth.</li>
                <li>Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to al dente, about 18-20 minutes. You may not need all of the broth.</li>
                <li>Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter and grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and let it sit for a couple of minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy your gourmet mushroom risotto!</li>
