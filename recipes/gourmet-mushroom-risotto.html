                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided.</li>
                <li>1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced.</li>

                <li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice.</li>
                <li>½ cup dry white wine.</li>

                <div class="steps">    
                <li>In a saucepan, heat the vegetable broth and keep it warm over low heat.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they release their moisture and become tender.</li>
                <li>Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and stir to coat the rice with the oil and butter. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the rice is lightly toasted.</li>
                <li>Pour in the white wine and cook, stirring constantly, until the wine is mostly absorbed by the rice.</li>
                <li>Begin adding the warm vegetable broth one ladle at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until most of the liquid is absorbed before adding the next ladle of broth.</li>
                <li>Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to al dente, about 18-20 minutes. You may not need all of the broth.</li>
                <li>Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter and grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and let it sit for a couple of minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy your gourmet mushroom risotto!</li></div>
